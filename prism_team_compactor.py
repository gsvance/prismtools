# Python wrapper program for parallelization of PRISM (part 3 of 3)
# Goal 1: produce post-processed yields for every particle from an SNSPH run
# Goal 2: avoid having to submit 950k sbatch jobs--that way lies madness
# Goal 3: organize all the output from PRISM after the processing is done
# This script exists to clean up all of the PRISM outputs after the fact
